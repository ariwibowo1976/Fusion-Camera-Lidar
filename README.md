# FFCL : Fuzzy Fusion Camera Lidar for 4D Object Detection
Fusion 2D Camera Object Detection + 3D Lidar Object Detection (Kitti dataset)
![Diagram](figures/ffclv0_1.png)

## How to set up : 

### Download 3D and 2D detections, which ones to download depends on what you want to run:
We thank other researchers for opening their code and data to the community and therefore provide links to their data directly in hopes that you will also check out their great work!
A cloud download link is provided for data that was generated by us using their open source code but was not immediately available.


* KITTI 2D Object Detections YOLOv3 from https://github.com/farhanaristo/YOLOv3-KITTI-With-Result-Format

* KITTI 3D Object Detections SECOND, PointPillars, etc from https://github.com/farhanaristo/mmdetection3d

* KITT 3D Object Detections PointGNN from https://github.com/WeijingShi/Point-GNN

### Compilation:

1. `cmake ./`
2. `make`

### Usage:
Run the inference by:

    ./fusion result_2DCamera_dir result_3DLidar_dir


Example:

    ./fusion data/camera/outputYOLOv3/ data/lidar/outputSECOND/

Note that you don't have to detect over all KITTI training data. The evaluator only evaluates samples whose result files exist.

## Evaluation

You can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/asharakeh/kitti_native_evaluation) to evaluate with the kitti dataset
